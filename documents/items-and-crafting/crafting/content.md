# 3 - Crafting
Crafting is the process of taking ingredients that have been harvested and combining them into useful items. To craft you first need a recipe or blueprint describing the process of making an item. The recipe/plan will also list the ingredients required (which must first be harvested) and the work bench required to creat the item.

Once you have the ingredients, the skills and the work bench you can chose to "make" an item (or multiple items) from the recipe dialog. Clicking on a work bench will also bring up your list of recipes.
