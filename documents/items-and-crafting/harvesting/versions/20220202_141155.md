# 2 - Harvesting
The world of Yore has many natural resources that can be harvested and used to create useful items. To harvest an item you will need an appropriate tool (or weapon in some cases) and enough skill to be able to use it to extra the item. In some cases a resource will only be harvested when a tool of sufficient quality is used. 
## Fishing
To fish you must find water (or other liquid) and have an appropriate rod. Bait can be used to increase the chances of finding rarer catches. Assuming you have a rod, clicking on any reachable water start fishing. Be patient, fishing can take some time, but it can be quite rewarding.
## Lumber Jacking
There are many varied trees in the world and most can be used as sources of wood. To get wood from trees you must have an axe (or other lumberjack skilled tool) in your backpack. Clicking on the trunk of the tree will start the chopping. Different types of tree require specific tools and skills.
