# 1 - Items
The world of Yore is full of items that can be found, harvested, bought and recieved as rewards for quests. Items are loosely categoried into quest items, ingredients, consumable and equipment.

Items can either be placed in your main backpack or in the bank available in most taverns. Items placed in your backpack are lost if you die unless they are protected quest items or you have them equipped.
## Quest Items
Quest items are things that you are given or find to complete quests. These items are normally not useful for anything else but care should be taken not to lose them. If you do lose a quest item you will often have to restart the quest by giving it up in the quest dialog.
## Ingredients
Ingredients are used in crafting and are gathered either by harvesting natural resources or by slaying evil monsters and collecting their drops. Different recipes call for varying ingredients as described in the [Crafting](https://talesofyore.com/guide/items-and-crafting/crafting) section.
## Consumable
