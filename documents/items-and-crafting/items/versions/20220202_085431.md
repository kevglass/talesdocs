# 1 - Items
The world of Yore is full of items that can be found, harvested, bought and recieved as rewards for quests. Items are loosely categoried into quest items, ingredients, consumable and equipment.

Items can either be placed in your main backpack or in the bank available in most taverns. Items placed in your backpack are lost if you die unless they are protected quest items or you have them equipped.
## Quest Items
Quest items are things that you are given or find to complete quests. These items are normally not useful for anything else but care should be taken not to lose them. If you do lose a quest item you will often have to restart the quest by giving it up in the quest dialog.
## Ingredients
Ingredients are used in crafting and are gathered either by harvesting natural resources or by slaying evil monsters and collecting their drops. Different recipes call for varying ingredients as described in the [Crafting](https://talesofyore.com/guide/items-and-crafting/crafting) section.
## Consumable
Consumable items are one use items that can be used for various things from ammunitition for your ranged weapons to potions for healing and recovering mana. Consumable items are generally stackable and when using them you'll use up a single item from the stack. 

In Tales of Yore there is no limit to how much you carry so you are welcome to carry round 100s of potions if that suits your play style. 
## Equipment
Equipment comes in two forms, that which you use and that which you wear. 

Useable items are held in your inventory (and potentially qucik slots). These items are used by either selecting the "use" option or double clicking/tapping on the item in your inventory (click once if in your quick slots). These items generally serve a simple purpose, like viewing a map but do not consume the item.

Other requipment is worn or wield. These items have a "slot" or position on the body in which the item is equipped. You can only wear or equip one item in any given slot, e.g. you can only wear one helmet at a time. The equipment slots are as follows:

| Slot | Description | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Head     | Used for helmets, circlets and hats     |
| Face     | Used for masks, glasses and disguises     |
| Body     | Used for shirts, armour     |
| Legs     | Used for belts, greaves and robes     |
| Feet     | Used for boots, sandles etc     |
| Primary     | Used for weapons and tools |
| Off-Hand  | Used for ammo, shields and magic tomes |
| Back | Used for cloaks, capes and rivers |
