## Skills
Skills range from 0 to 100. The maximum number of skills a player can hold currently is 420, spread across the 12 skills. Skills are improved by using them. Note that many items require a certain skill level to use.

By default all skills are set to increase when practicing. However, in some cases it makes sense to lock a skill in place or cause it to be forgotten over time. This can be controlled using the arrows to the right of the skills in the skills popup window. 

For instance, if a character is training to become a swordsman they may choose to forget what they know about mace weapons so that they may use those skill points on sword.
