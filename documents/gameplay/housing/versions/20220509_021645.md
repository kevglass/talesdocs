# 6 - Housing
The world of Yore allows players to own houses which they can use as storage, guild locations, shops or a mixture of all three. Houses give players the chance to build part of Yore but we do request that you try to keep the house design in line with the vibe of Yore.

## Buying a House

To buy a house a player must purchase an open land plot. Note that these plots come up regularly and the world is always growing adding new plots. If there aren't any available rest assured some more will be along promptly.

The initial purchase of the house costs 500k gold. As with everything in Tales of Yore, there are no short cuts or pay to win, you have to save your gold and earn the plot. When you buy a plot you get the first floor of your house as part of the deal. You can configure how you want the house to look by going into your inventory and clicking the house deed in the bottom left.

Please note you can't remove or sell a floor once it's been added to the house. To upgrade your house you must be near it.

## Selling a House

If you need money you may choose to sell your house. You get back the initial plot purchase price. Be careful though, if you sell your house you will lose any items that are inside!

To sell your house use the option in the house deed as shown above.

## Decorating
Home owners in Yore are very proud of their property and often decorate both the inside and outside. To decorate a house players can either craft or buy furniture.
