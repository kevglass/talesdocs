# 6 - Housing
The world of Yore allows players to own houses which they can use as storage, guild locations, shops or a mixture of all three. Houses give players the chance to build part of Yore but we do request that you try to keep the house design in line with the vibe of Yore.

Buying a House

To buy a house a player must purchase an open land plot. Note that these plots come up regularly and the world is always growing adding new plots. If there aren't any available rest assured some more will be along promptly.

The initial purchase of the house costs 500k gold. As with everything in Tales of Yore, there are no short cuts or pay to win, you have to save your gold and earn the plot. When you buy a plot you get the first floor of your house as part of the deal. You can configure how you want the house to look by going into your inventory and clicking the house deed in the bottom left.

This is also where you upgrade and sell your house.
