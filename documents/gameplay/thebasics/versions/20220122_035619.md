# 1 - The Basics
## Creating a Character
In Tales of Yore you create a hero to explore the world of Yore. You can create as many characters as you like and each can have a unique appearance.

Once your character is created you can change your look any time by selecting "Recreate Character" - as long as you use the same name the character progression will be saved.
## Settings
The settings panel can be accessed by clicking or tapping the cog icon in the top right of the screen.

The setting panel includes options to set the password and email associated with the account. It is important to do this so you can recover your character should you forget the password and so that you can continue your adventure on other devices. 

The panel also links to your Player Page - this page gives details of how much of the current content you have completed and records your monster kills. The player page initially shows your own page but can be used to look at any other player.
## Moving Around
To move around the world click or tap the location that you want to move to. If your player can reach the location they will walk threre. If you walk into a portal between places in the world you'll move to the new place (portals are doors, edges, magic gates etc). 
## Talking to Folks
There are many non-player characters (NPCs) in the world. These characters fill the world with stories and quests. To talk to an NPC click on them. Your character must be close to an NPC to talk to them. If you click on an NPC thats not close enough your player will walk to them before talking to them.

While talking to an NPC you will have several options to reply with. Read what the NPCs say carefully as there are many hints and guides within the text to help you solve the quests of the game. A gold coin on an option indicates there will be a cost associated with choosing the option.

If an NPC has something important to say they will often have a speech bubble above their head. If you'd rather not have these hints then they can be turned off in the game settings. Note however that even with these hints turned on not every twist and turn of the quests is sign posted so easily.
