# 1 - The Basics
## Creating a Character
In Tales of Yore you create a hero to explore the world of Yore. You can create as many characters as you like and each can have a unique appearance. 

Once your character is created you can change your look any time by selecting "Recreate Character" - as long as you use the same name the character progression will be saved.
