The list of quests tell you the task at hand and who to return to once the quest is complete. There is also the option to use hints to the quest which in most cases will give you a bit of help on the current step in the quest.

## Completing Quests
Once a quest is completed return to the appropriate NPC for the reward. Sometimes this will simply be keeping a quest item, sometimes there will be a separate reward and then other times there may be new areas of the world open to you through completing the quest.
